# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Requirements

In addition to bleeding edge NeoVim, you'll also need to install some
additional libraries and tools to take advantage of all of the plugins.
The most demanding is probably `treesitter`, which needs `node` and compiles
language help as needed.

- `ripgrep`
- `fzf`
- `python3`, preferably with NeoVim bindings
- `node`
- Some C/C++ compiler stack, like `gcc`
- `go` compiler
- `lazygit`

On Fedora, all of these packages should be available through `dnf`.
