## Plugins for writing and coding

This is a small dotfile collection for writing and coding in NeoVim.
Packages are managed using `Vundle`, which is required before these
plugins can be used.

The highlights are:

1. Goyo + Limelight for distraction-free writing
2. Airline
3. Markdown packages such as `tabular` and `vim-markdown`
4. LaTeX integration with `vimtex`, `vim-latex`, and `neotex`
5. Integration with Pandoc with `vim-pandoc` and `vim-pandoc-syntax`
6. Color scheme integration with PyWal
7. `syntastic` for syntax highlighting

## Installation

First setup Vundle by following the instructions on git, making sure
to adapt it for installation on NeoVim. On Linux, the config files are
generally found in \$HOME/.config/nvim/

Afterwards, just run `:PluginInstall` in a NeoVim session.
